Python Game Repo
DATE: 11/27/2013

This is a repository where I put games I am working on in here. Most are written in Python and Pygame. The sandbox directory contains sample code from 'Making Games With Python and PyGame' book. The book is free to download and you can find itwith a simple Google search. 

I am currently working on battleship game, experimenting as I go.
